## Greetings 😎👋

- 🔭 I’m bringing emerging AI technologies to run on-device on Apple & Meta devices:
    - Vision Language Models (VLMs)
    - Semantic Segmentation
    - Speech
    - Large Language Models (LLMs) w/RAG
    - ...to make awesome applications 😍
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about anything AI that might working on-device
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything AI that might work on-device
- 🤔 Much like other people, I’m looking for help with converting models between formats
